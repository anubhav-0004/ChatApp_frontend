# React + Vite

This is a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some basic ESLint rules. Vite ensures a fast development experience with an optimized build process.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh** for instant updates during development.
- Support for JSX and modern JavaScript features.
- Minimal configuration for quick project setup.
- Easily extendable for larger applications.

## Official Plugins

Two official plugins are available for React + Vite:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for handling React Fast Refresh.
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for faster builds and Fast Refresh.
